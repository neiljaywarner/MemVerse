const val RATINGS_INFO_TEXT = """

To begin, type the text of the verse as you remember it into the grey box.
As you type, Memverse will give you live feedback.
When Memverse gives you the "Correct" message, it is time to rate your review.

The choices are:

5. Remembered - Perfect - Just use this one when you want it to move towards the end of the list
4. Remembered - Hesitation
3. Remembered - Difficult - use this one most as long as you don't have to tap "show verse"
2. Don't Know - Familiar
1. Don't Know - No Idea

You shouldn't think of the five options as though you are grading yourself on a test.
Rather, think of them as you giving feedback to the Memverse system to allow it to adjust the review schedule optimally.
It is designed to be a flexible system.

Finally, don't agonize too much over which rating you choose.
If you remembered the verse select one in the 3 - 5 range.
If you can't remember it select 1 or 2. The Memverse algorithm will gradually adjust over time.
